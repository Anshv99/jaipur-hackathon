Our goal is to leverage the power of IoT technologies to develop a compact hydroponics unit that streamlines crop cultivation for improved efficiency and greater yields. With this innovative system, we will be able to accurately monitor and optimize crop growth by precisely controlling water levels and detecting any potential blockages in the system. Additionally, we are creating a user-friendly web application that will allow farmers to easily visualize and manage the data from the hydroponics unit, making it an invaluable tool for optimizing crop cultivation on a larger scale.
